This collection of files is useful for getting a Rails app up and running with headless JSSpec tests for your JavaScript files.

CHANGELOG

2008/08/19 - mdotterer
 - Updated JSSpec to 2008/01/07 Version
 - Created console_logger.js to display results of new version to console
   - Added color
 - Created runner.js to run any number of spec files with one set of results
    and to pull out execution code to a common place
 - Monkey patched JSSpec::Spec::extractOutSpecialEntries to ignore methods that
     Prototype adds to Object
 - Pulled generic library loads out of config.js so that config.js can be completely
    customized for your project
 - Added Rhino into the repository for convience
 - Changed the rake task to run all of the files in
    spec/javascripts/*_spec.js at once using runner.js
2008/08/20
 - Added simple spec compiler to create html files that can be run in the browser.

TODO
 - Make it easier to change the html fixture in the compiled specs.
 - Make color optional
 - Make the runner and the compiler accept wildcards in their arguments

KNOWN ISSUES
 - When prototype is included and a spec fails the error report lists:
     'Cannot find function each in object [ "" ].'
 - Expected and actual values don't appear in the report when a spec fails
 - Setting window.location will cause weird behavior when specs are compiled (see TODO item)
